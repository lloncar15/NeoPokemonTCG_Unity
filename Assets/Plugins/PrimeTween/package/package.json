    "changelog": "## [1.3.4] - 2025-10-15\n### Changed\n- Sequence's 'CycleMode' has been changed to 'SequenceCycleMode'.\n- 'SetRemainingCycles()' now works with negative 'timeScale'. https://github.com/KyryloKuzyk/PrimeTween/issues/203.\n- Improved animation debugging in PrimeTweenManager inspector.\n### Fixed\n- Fixed: inserting animations into a Sequence with negative 'atTime' decreases sequence duration. https://github.com/KyryloKuzyk/PrimeTween/issues/202.\n- Fixed: 'startDelay' is ignored when tween's duration is zero. https://github.com/KyryloKuzyk/PrimeTween/issues/200\n- Fixed: 'elapsedTimeTotal', 'elapsedTime', and 'progressTotal' are calculated incorrectly for nested tweens.\n- Fixed: animating 'ScrollRect.normalizedPosition' can throw exception if 'ScrollRect.content' is null.\n- Fixed: if Unity Editor is open for a long time, time measurement gets imprecise when running animations in Edit mode."
